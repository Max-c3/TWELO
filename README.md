# TWELO â€” Identification and Obfuscation of personal data in drone images
This repository contains the code for the graduation project for the *Data and ML* Bootcamp by Le Wagon.

Using drone images from the company [Kestrix](http://kestrix.io), we developed a computer vision model to identify and obfuscate personal data in drone images, ensuring data protection and seamless integration.

To develop the model, we used the pretrained model [YOLOv8](https://yolov8.org) and fine-tuned on kaggle. The final accuracy was 88%.

Because of the model we used, YOLO, which stands for *You Only Look Once*, we decided to call our project *They Won't Even Look Once*, short *TWELO*.

The final website can be seen [here](https://twelo-web.streamlit.app).
